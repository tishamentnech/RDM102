    "> The human body is a very interesting place. One fascinating part of our body is the bacterial cultures that live in our belly buttons. We have data taken from several people showing what types of bacteria live in their belly buttons. We've controlled for several things, and our findings need to be analyzed further. The interplay between human and microbe is what you'll investigate as a part of this study.\n",

    "Sheet 1 contains more information on the species of the various Bacteria / Archaea found on each participant.  Data set 2 is much easier to read due to the orientation of the different columns and rows data set 1 has opposite columns and headers from data set 2. It is not clear from the data sets why one has more participants than the other. Depending on which data set we do for the project it will determine the different mean, median, and modes. I will focus on the demographics of the participants. It is also possible to count how often the bacteria occur. Data set 2 will also include more specific / condensed information about the different  species which will be easier to read and count / classify. The unclear reason between the participants is an apparent bias of the data. There are also several fields that are null / unfilled. One bias will be how I decide to deal with those. There is also a bias in the data if the participants did not live in the same zipcode for the fields \"where lived from 0-13 and where lived from 13-19\" This probably does not give an accurate view of which environments effect the type of bacteria / archaea growth. Some potential bias from the project history and article is in the methods of rarefaction of the different samples. Some parts claim it was 400 reads per sample and the other data in sets 1 and 2 claim 1000 reads. This will provide different determiniations of species. Also the paper only reports 60 samples when they have somewhere between 153 and 273. Their blog mentions that they will be doing different analysis of the samples which will increase over time which would give reason to the different numbers. One question that I have is what will be the data set we use for this project?\n",

I ended up spending about 25 hours cleaning data including the fail attempts to figure out how to do what I needed to in OpenRefine.

    "\n",
    "#### Process for cleaning:\n",
    "Preface: The way I wanted to clean my data was a way to merge the similar bacteria phenotypes because they are listed multiple times for each participant. By merging and added the amount in the different cells. I was not able to figure out how to do this in OpenRefine. If anyone knows how, please let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "01. I did add the larger spreadsheet in OpenRefine to facet by groups to help with the work with the spreadsheet.\n",
    "02. Upload working data in a new spreadsheet of only the large data sheet without metadata and notes sheet.\n",
    "03. Convert the sheet into a table for filtering and editing.\n",
    "04. Use the facets by number to identify the large groups as you work through consolidation.\n",
    "05. Once filtered by largest phenotype to smaller phenotype. Use this formula to add all values in a row by participant =SUM(cell:cell) at the bottom of the column to create a new row of the merged / added values for that specific phenotype. \n",
    "06. Once this is done for the column you can either formulas into adjacent cells by using the fill handle across the row or You can also press Ctrl+R to fill the formula to the right in a row. First select the cell that has the formula you want to fill, then select the cells to the right of it, and then press Ctrl+R.  \n",
    "07. After you've completed the formula across the row you can then copy the title of the phenotype into the new row of added values. \n",
    "08. To ensure that you are not contingent on the mathematical formula and those cells you can copy that row of values with the phenotype and then re-paste that into a new sheet. When doing this you want to make sure that you paste the values only. This will need to be done by using the drop down paste button in the toolbar and selecting paste values.\n",
    "09. This step is repeated until you get down the list of facets that there are only 1 left of that facet.\n",
    "10. Once you are to the list of facets with the single appearance you can copy and paste those values into the new sheet of the value only sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is as tedious as a process as it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final product of consolidation contains 333 rows and 154 columns. \n"
